# Project analysis

## Target user profile:

This page is oriented for HR or recruitment person that wants to find more information about the resume owner.

## Visual design:

This project was inspired by a dozen of diferent cv templates that I found on pages like:
* zety.es
* novoresume.com
  
## Technologies and Libraries

* Bootstrap: I decided to use bootstrap because its a really complete set of tools and components, that are easy to implement, are designed to be responsive and have a really easy to use grid system that i personaly really like.

* Font Awesome: Really good and big librari of icons.

* Slipsum (Samuel L. Ipsum): Used to generate the lorem ipsum from samuel Jackson lines.
